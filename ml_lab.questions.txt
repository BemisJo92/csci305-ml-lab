Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. This function takes every number in a set and adds one to it.

3. I'm going to assume that since nothing follows *b* that this
question and the preceding question are asking about the lines that
come before the two comments, rather than after. The line that comes
before *a* defines a function f that takes in a list [] and, should
that list be empty, return an empty list [].

4. The line preceding *b* says that if the first definition of f
does not apply to the list, a new definition is created that says
that the list should be split into two parts, the first element of
the list (the head), and every other element in the list (the tail)
for every element in the list that is passed into f, it should
have 1 added to it and then returned to the list. f is then called
recursively with the remaining values in the list.

5. For this input I get an error saying "Operator and operand don't
agree [tycon mismatch]" and this is because what is passed in is a
list, where isMember is checking for sets.

6. My method creates a set using tail recursion because it checks
if e is in the set as the function goes deeper in the set. If the
method were to reach the base case and then check if e were in the
set on the way back out of the deepest part of the set, then it would
be head recursion. 

7.

8. Tail recursion allows for implementation that is similar in
efficiency as a goto statement, which allows for efficient structured
programming. Using tail recursion uses about as much memory as an
equivalent loop.
