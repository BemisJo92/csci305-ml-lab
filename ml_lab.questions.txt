Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. This function takes every number in a set and adds one to it.

3. I'm going to assume that since nothing follows *b* that this
question and the preceding question are asking about the lines that
come before the two comments, rather than after. The line that comes
before *a* defines a function f that takes in a list [] and returns
a list [].

4. The line preceding *b* says that for every element in the list
that is passed into f should have 1 added to it and then returned
to the list.
